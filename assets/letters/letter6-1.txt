Dear Bill,

As Alan's probably told you, I have been tasked with the command of Hut 8. I've heard a lot about the work you've been doing and I must say I'm impressed. At this stage, with our plans to take the fight back across the channel, we can be certain of very little, but your efforts have contributed significantly.

HQ have determined with full confidence that our plans to launch a beachhead between Boulogne and Le Havre are unsuitable, and have decided that further military build-up is required. As far as expected dates are concerned, if we attack across the channel, it will likely take place after operations in Africa have run their course.

That being said, plans are already being put in place for a future invasion. A briefing on 'Operation Overlord' will take place at 1000 hours, I'll see you there.

Hugh
