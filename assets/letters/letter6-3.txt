Dear Bill,

As Alan's probably told you, I have been tasked with the command of Hut 8. I've heard a lot about the work you've been doing and I must say I'm impressed. At this stage, with our plans to take the fight back across the channel, we can be certain of very little, but your efforts have contributed significantly.

Upon receiving a great deal of concerning information, HQ has decided to drop plans to seize Brest and Cherbourg and mass troops in the Cotentin Peninsula. They have also concluded that further military build-up is required. As far as expected dates are concerned, if we attack across the channel, it will likely take place after operations in Africa have run their course.

That being said, plans are already being put in place for a future invasion. A briefing on 'Operation Overlord' will take place at 1000 hours, I'll see you there.
