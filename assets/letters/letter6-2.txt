Dear Bill,

As Alan's probably told you, I've been tasked with the command of Hut 8 here at Bletchley. I've heard a lot about the work you've been doing here these past few months.

Despite your best efforts we've not managed to keep up with the influx of German decrypts. Fortunately at this early stage of proceedings our failure has not yet been of critical concern. However, from here on in we all need to put in our best effort to make sure that future plans run smoothly.

Due to a lack of viable information, HQ have decided to scrap plans to establish a beachhead between Boulogne and Le Havre. Operations in Africa are currently their number one priority.

That being said, plans are already being put in place for a future invasion. A briefing on 'Operation Overlord' will take place at 1000 hours, I'll see you there.

Hugh
