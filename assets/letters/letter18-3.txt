Dated March 1944

Dear William,

First order of business today is a pleasant one. Our efforts to conceal the failure of our landing exercise has thus far - to our knowledge - been successful. With the day of the actual assault looming around the corner, this is very good news indeed.

One could say almost a God send, given the present state of affairs. With the balance of information currently in favour of the Germans, who knows, perhaps this could be the turning point in our efforts. Capitalise on this, William, and we might get a well-earned break yet.
