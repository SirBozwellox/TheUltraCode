Dear William,

I have an update of some importance. In February the Germans introduced a new, more advanced, rotor stream cipher machine, for which our current code-breaking methods have proven a somewhat inadequate match. Fortunately, there have recently been some developments in working out the cam settings of the wheels of these 'Tunny' machines, which should soon increase the volume of information we can crack.

Additionally with our bombing campaign on Germany in full swing, and yielding much desired results, your presence is now requested for another important operation. 'Gambit', as it has been dubbed, pertains to uncovering German submarine operations in the channel. We'll fill you in more at the briefing.

P.S. I don't suppose you have a spare bike chain I can borrow? Mine keeps breaking.
