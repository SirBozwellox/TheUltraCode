Dated January 1944

Dear Mr. Taylor,

>3
I would like to commend you for your efforts so far, it seems we are starting to turn this war around at last. The intel you've gathered has been vital in keeping our boys on the front line alive.

But your work isn't over yet, this is the final push before the invasion of Europe. Any information we can provide in the coming months will be crucial for an Allied victory.

Best get to it.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
