Dated May 1944

Dear Mr. Taylor,

>3
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your excellent work thus far on decrypting vital German intelligence. Your efforts have been imperative to our war stratagems.

This is the final stretch before the invasion and this may well be our last chance to get the information we need to make it a success.

Nevertheless, I trust that you will succeed.

Good luck.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
