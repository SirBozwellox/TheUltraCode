Dated January 1944

Dear Mr. Taylor,

>3
Surplus to our regular communications, I have some rather unfortunate news for you and the staff. Our old colleague, Mr. Newman, was recently killed whilst on board a vessel bound to America. The loss of valuable ex-staff members does not bode well for us. He will be sorely missed.

You will be informed of the funeral date in due course. Nevertheless, for now mourning is a luxury that we cannot afford; stay focused over the coming days, and let's try to turn this war around.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
