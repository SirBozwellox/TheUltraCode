Dear William,

With the final preparations underway for D-Day, things are certainly starting to look up for our efforts. Now it's time to make the final push.

Gather whatever intelligence you can for the remaining operations. While the going is good, we need to make the coming days count in order to ensure everything we need is in place.

Let's get down to it then, shall we?
