Dated May 1944

Mr. Taylor,

It is with great pleasure that I am now able to inform you that our intelligence efforts towards Operation Overlord have now been completed. Thanks to your accomplishments, as well as those of your colleagues here at Bletchley Park, our assault on the continent portends great results.

Although only time will tell how things are going to pan out for us, I believe a celebration is in order. See me and the brass in the Operations Room for debriefing.

Good work indeed, Mr. Taylor.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
