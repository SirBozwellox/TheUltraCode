Dear William,

I have an update of some importance. In February the Germans introduced a new, more advanced, rotor stream cipher machine, for which our current code-breaking methods have proven a somewhat inadequate match. Fortunately, there have recently been some developments in working out the cam settings of the wheels of these 'Tunny' machines, which should soon increase the volume of information we can crack.

Lastly, recent word is that our bombing campaign continues to go well, but we do require better information on our targets to make these efforts decisive.

P.S. I don't suppose you have a spare bike chain I can borrow? Mine keeps breaking.
