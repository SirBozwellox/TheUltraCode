Dear Bill,

As Alan's probably told you, I've been tasked with the command of Hut 8 here at Bletchley. I've heard a lot about the work you've been doing here these past few months.

Despite your best efforts we've not managed to keep up with the influx of German decrypts. Fortunately at this early stage of proceedings our failure has not yet been of critical concern. However, from here on in we all need to put in our best effort to make sure that future plans run smoothly.

Due to a lack of viable information, HQ have decided to scrap plans to seize Brest and Cherbourg. Additionally, without knowing fully how many troops will be required to break-out of the Cotentin Peninsula, plans to do so have been deemed too risky. Operations in Africa are currently their number one priority.

That being said, in place of previous plans they have also begun work on a new invasion strategy designed for the continent, dubbed 'Operation Overlord'. We will be expected to contribute whatever we can, and I am sure as the war progresses this may yet come to be of vital importance. I'll see you at the briefing.
