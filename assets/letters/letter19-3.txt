Dear William,

Despite our falling behind on our decryption efforts, we still have been able to assemble enough information to ensure at least decent odds for the upcoming invasion.

Though at this juncture we have no way to tell how things will pan out for us, and I fear we have much to do beyond the Normandy landings, this certainly marks cause for celebration.

But before that, get to the Operations Room for debriefing. All in all, you've done a fantastic job, William. Enjoy some respite.
