Dated March 1944

Dear William,

First order of business today is a pleasant one. Our efforts to conceal the failure of our landing exercise has thus far - to our knowledge - been successful. With the day of the actual assault looming around the corner, this is very good news indeed.

As things stand, we have a great deal of information in place to ensure that our landings be a success. Though they certainly won't mark the end of our efforts here, it is time to begin the final push with regards to the assault. Perhaps, once they have been completed, and - one would hope - successfully at that, we can have something of a well-earned break.

In the meantime, see you in the hut.
