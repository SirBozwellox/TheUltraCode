Dear William,

The recent opening of our bombing campaign against the Germans has, unfortunately, failed to make a significant impact on their production capacities thus far. Any intel you can provide for 'Operation Pointblank' is much needed in these desperate times.

As I'm sure you are aware, the Germans have launched a new offensive on the Eastern front in an attempt to encircle the Soviets in Kursk. However their attack has, according to recent reports, stalled. This is excellent news of course. Perhaps too good, because the sources on the ground point towards the possibility that someone here has been leaking information to the Soviets.

Of course, German failure in the East perhaps owes something to the diversion of Nazi forces to face our recent assault on Sicily, so this may simply be a hunch. But we have also recently received reports of suspicious activity around Hut 3, the building where the translated decrypts are kept. So if you notice anything awry then please do report it.

In any case, best of luck in your work today.
