Dated May 1944

Mr. Taylor,

The clock is ticking, and with things as they are I can only hope you take seriously our current predicament.

Overlord and Neptune are our last chance to turn the tide of the war, and today is the only opportunity left to get the information we need to at least give ourselves a chance. It may not count for much, but I know that you and your colleagues have what it takes to get this done.

Good luck, Mr. Taylor. We may all need it.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
