Dated September 1943

Dear Mr. Taylor,

Information has just began coming in on the opening stages of our offensive on mainland Italy. So far, General Montgomery's forces have managed a successful landing at Salerno, Calabria and Taranto, but unfortunately due to heavy Axis resistance they have not yet been able to establish a safe beachhead.

We have also received reports with regards to our efforts on 'Operation Bodyguard'. Despite our best efforts, the Germans have cottoned on to the fact that our offensive at Normandy will be the primary attack itself. Unfortunately, this means our landing troops can expect to have to fight through stiff resistance.

That is all for today. See you after work.
