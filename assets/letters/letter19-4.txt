Dear William,

Though as I am sure you are aware things do not look good for us, we still have the chance to turn the tide. Focus your attention on any remaining operations, and do not let up. If we can assemble the right intelligence ahead of the landings, we might just be able to make a good go of things.

I trust that you know the gravity of our situation, as well as what will be required of us all.

Good luck.
