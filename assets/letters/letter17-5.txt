Dear Bill,

Intercepted German damage reports on our latest air-raid of Berlin have indicated massive damage. While we have not been able to validify this information with our own reconnaissance, this may well prove to be a major step in our favour.

In addition, our efforts to sniff out the positions of German U-Boats have thus far been highly successful. With the upper hand in information, we should be able to ensure that our troops all make it safely on shore.

Military Intelligence have called on us to gather intel for another important operation. 'Operation Neptune', as they have dubbed it, will plan for the paradropping of troops behind enemy lines to target German radar stations ahead of any amphibious or land assault we might mount. Hence, it will be crucial for us to ascertain the locations of said stations, as well as any other essential information of the sort.

I'll see you in the briefing room.
