Dear Bill,

Intercepted German damage reports on our latest air-raid of Berlin have indicated massive damage. While we have not been able to validify this information with our own reconnaissance, this may well prove to be a major step in our favour.

This is certainly a boon in light of our recent failure to detect the positions of German U-Boats in the English Channel. Although, when the time for the crossing comes, our own troops will remain on high alert, I fear we cannot guarantee the safe passage of our troops to France.

Military Intelligence have called on us to gather intel for another important operation. 'Operation Neptune', as they have dubbed it, will plan for the paradropping of troops behind enemy lines to target German radar stations ahead of any amphibious or land assault we might mount. Hence, it will be crucial for us to ascertain the locations of said stations, as well as any other essential information of the sort.

I'll see you in the briefing room.
