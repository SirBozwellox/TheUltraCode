Dated February 1944

Dear Bill,

We have some troubling news. Following an aircraft raid on Berlin, the German's have falsified reports of the damage in an effort to divert future bombing raids away from the capital. Fortunately, we were able to see through this deception, however it is imperative that we remain vigilant. It seems as if the Germans have cottoned on to us, and we need to make sure they don't beat us at our own game.

With that in mind, we have plenty for you to do today. Get to it.
