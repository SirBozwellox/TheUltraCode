Dear Bill,

We have some troubling news. Following an aircraft raid on Berlin, the Germans have falsified reports of the damage in an effort to divert future bombing raids away from the capital. Fortunately, we were able to see through this deception, however it is imperative that we remain vigilant. It seems as if the Germans have cottoned on to us, and we need to make sure they don't beat us at our own game.

That being said, our efforts to sniff out the positions of German U-Boats have thus far been highly successful. With the upper hand in information, we should be able to ensure that our troops all make it safely on shore.

Don't rest too easy though. Military Intelligence have called on us to gather intel for another important operation. 'Operation Neptune', as they have dubbed it, will plan for the paradropping of troops behind enemy lines to target German radar stations ahead of any amphibious or land assault we might mount. Hence, it will be crucial for us to ascertain the locations of said stations, as well as any other essential information of the sort.

I'll see you in the briefing room.
