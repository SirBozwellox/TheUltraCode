Dated August 1943

Dear Bill,

As you may know Mr. Milner-Barry will be replacing Mr. Welchman as head of Hut 6. He'll certainly be missed but of course Milner-Barry has our full confidence going forward.

With regards to 'Operation Pointblank', the US have just begun sending their B-24s in to begin bombing Nazi oil production facilities, under the denomination of 'Operation Tidal Wave'. We can only hope that their efforts have some impact on the Luftwaffe's aircraft capacities.

Finally, some unfortunate news. A number of unidentified U-Boats recently sank a troop of supply ships off the Bay of Biscay. Reports suggest the attack may have been intercepted. If only we could have done something here to anticipate it.

That is all for today, see you in the hut.
