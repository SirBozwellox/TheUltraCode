Dated September 1943

Dear Mr. Taylor,

Information has just began coming in on the opening stages of our offensive on mainland Italy. So far, General Montgomery's forces have managed a successful landing at Salerno, Calabria and Taranto, but unfortunately due to heavy Axis resistance they have not yet been able to establish a safe beachhead.

We have also received reports with regards to our efforts on 'Operation Bodyguard', and I believe a congratulations is in order, because we have successfully influenced the Germans into diverting troops away from Normandy. This should, in the best-case scenario, give our landing forces much better odds in establishing a sufficient beachhead on the continent.

That is all for today. See you after work.
