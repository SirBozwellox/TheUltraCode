Dated December 1943

Dear Bill,

I am happy to announce that the Colossus Mk. 1 is finished. Despite the doubts that I know many of us shared with Mr. Newman, Flowers certainly came through for us. I look forward, as I am sure you do too, to seeing the new machine running.

This is certainly a boon in light of how events in the East and Mediterranean have been playing out. Watching our campaign on the Moro River in Italy stall and the Soviets barely manage to fight the Germans to a stalemate has been dispiriting to us all. So much so, that the Americans have seen fit in their bombing campaign on Bremen, Hamburg and Kiel to introduce fire bombs to innocent civilians. I have little faith that the Germans, after what we know of their aerial methods, will answer this with clemency.

There's a briefing this morning on the upcoming 'Operation Tiger'. There has been something of a mishap regarding trial runs for the Normandy landings, and H.Q. wants us to get to work on a hasty cover-up. We'll be required to gather a lot of intel in a short amount of time but completing the operation will seriously improve our chances of success at Normandy.
