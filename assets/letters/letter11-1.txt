Dated August 1943

Dear Bill,

As you may know Mr. Milner-Barry will be replacing Mr. Welchman as head of Hut 6. He'll certainly be missed but of course Milner-Barry has our full confidence going forward.

With regards to 'Operation Pointblank', the US have just begun sending their B-24s in to begin bombing Nazi oil production facilities, under the denomination of 'Operation Tidal Wave'. We can only hope that their efforts have some impact on the Luftwaffe's aircraft capacities.

Lastly, I thought it worth telling you that two German subs, U-383 and U-454, were recently sunk in the Bay of Biscay thanks to intercepted intelligence here at Bletchley. So keep up the good work, anything we can do to help the war effort is of vital importance.
