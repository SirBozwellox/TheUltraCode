Dated February 1944

Dear Bill,

We have some troubling news. Following an aircraft raid on Berlin, the Germans have falsified reports of the damage in an effort to divert future bombing raids away from the capital. Fortunately, we were able to see through this deception, however it is imperative that we remain vigilant. It seems as if the Germans have cottoned on to us, and we need to make sure they don't beat us at our own game.

This is certainly going to be imperative in light of our recent failure to detect the positions of German U-Boats in the English Channel. Although, when the time for the crossing comes, our own troops will remain on high alert, I fear we cannot guarantee the safe passage of our troops to France.

Yet we still do have time to press our advantage. Military Intelligence have called on us to gather intel for another important operation. 'Operation Neptune', as they have dubbed it, will plan for the paradropping of troops behind enemy lines to target German radar stations ahead of any amphibious or land assault we might mount. Hence, it will be crucial for us to ascertain the locations of said stations, as well as any other essential information of the sort.

I'll see you in the briefing room.
