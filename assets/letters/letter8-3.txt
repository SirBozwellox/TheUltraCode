Dated March 1943

Good morning Bill,

Alan is due back from America soon. I'd like to think we've done well in his absence but his return will no doubt be a boost to our efforts. And with the news that the Soviets have pushed the Germans back from Stalingrad we already have the enemy on the back foot.

In the meantime, make sure to acquaint yourself with Tommy Flowers at Dollis Hill if you get the chance. He's looking to be a very promising addition to the team there. I'm sure you're already familiar with Max Newman's efforts to mechanize the decryption process, and I can assure you that if Flowers' influence on the project is anything to go by, he might well prove useful to you.

Following the unfortunate failure of Fortitude, we will be now shifting our focus towards screening the planned invasion of Normandy, with the aim of making the Germans believe it's merely a diversion. I'll see you in the briefing room.

Hugh
