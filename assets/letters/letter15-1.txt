Dated December 1943

Dear Bill,

I am happy to announce that the Colossus Mk. 1 is finished. Despite the doubts that I know many of us shared with Mr. Newman, Flowers certainly came through for us. I look forward, as I am sure you do too, to seeing the new machine running.

Watching events in the Mediterranean and on the Eastern front unfold may have been a nerve-wracking affair, but thus far our campaign on the Moro River in Italy is going well, and the Soviets have been seeing great success since putting the Germans on the back foot at Kursk. Further to this, the Americans are really mounting the pressure in their bombing campaign on Bremen, Hamburg and Kiel.

There's a briefing this morning on the upcoming 'Operation Tiger'. There has been something of a mishap regarding trial runs for the Normandy landings, and H.Q. wants us to get to work on a hasty cover-up. We'll be required to gather a lot of intel in a short amount of time but completing the operation will seriously improve our chances of success at Normandy.
