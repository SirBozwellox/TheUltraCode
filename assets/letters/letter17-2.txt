Dear Bill,

Good news; intercepted German damage reports on our latest air-raid of Berlin have indicated massive damage. While we have not been able to validify this information with our own reconnaissance, this may well prove to be a major step in our favour.

Regardless, the odds are still stacked against us, and Military Intelligence need all the information they can get.
