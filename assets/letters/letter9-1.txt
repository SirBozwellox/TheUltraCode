Dated May 1943

Dear Mr. Taylor,

>3
Before we discuss your progress since your arrival at Bletchley Park, it will be worth discussing recent developments with regards to our American allies. With the Trident talks in progress, we've gotten word that decisions are being made between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill to determine the date for our invasion of Normandy, which has been provisionally set for May next year. Plans have also been put in place for an invasion of Sicily. With this news you now have a deadline.

Given your recent success on the job, we are sure you know that this means we would like you to continue to specialise in information regarding our invasion of mainland Europe. Your contribution to the war effort has been outstanding thus far. We look forward to seeing how you progress over the year to come.

Speaking of which, we have more work for you to do. We will save the chatter for the briefing, but suffice to say plans for a bombing campaign of Germany are being put into place under the title 'Pointblank.' I expect to see you there.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
