Dear Bill,

Information has just begun coming in on the opening stages of our offensive on mainland Italy. So far, General Montgomery's forces have managed a successful landing at Salerno, Calabria and Taranto and have gone on to establish an effective foothold on the peninsula.

We have also received reports with regards to our efforts on 'Operation Bodyguard'. Despite our best efforts, the Germans have cottoned on to the fact that our offensive at Normandy will be the primary attack itself. Unfortunately, this means that our landing troops can expect to have to fight through stiff resistance.

However with our bombing campaign on Germany in full swing, and yielding the desired results, your labor is now requested for another important operation. 'Gambit', as it has been dubbed, pertains to uncovering German submarine operations in the channel. We'll fill you in more at the briefing.
