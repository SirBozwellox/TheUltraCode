Dated May 1943

Dear Mr. Taylor,

>3
Before we discuss your progress since your arrival at Bletchley Park, it will be worth discussing recent developments with regards to our American allies. With the Trident talks in progress, we've gotten word that decisions are being made between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill to determine the date for our invasion of Normandy, which has been provisionally set for May next year. Plans have also been put in place for an invasion of Sicily. With this news you now have a deadline.

Unfortunately your recent work has not been enough to sway the war effort in our favour, so I hope in the coming year you and the team in Hut 8 can provide some more substantial results.

Speaking of which, we have more work for you to do. We will save the chatter for the briefing, but suffice it to say plans for a bombing campaign of Germany are now being put in place under the title 'Pointblank.' I'll see you there.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
