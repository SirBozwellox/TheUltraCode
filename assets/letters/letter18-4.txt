Dated March 1944

Dear William,

I have some unfortunate news. We have just gotten word from another one of our listening posts that the Germans have caught wind of our failed practice run of the Normandy landings. This is very un-serendipitous indeed, especially given how close the real invasion is. We can only hope that what they know at present is not enough to trounce us when the time comes.

This makes what is certainly an already desperate situation even more dire for us. With the Germans holding such an upper-hand on us in terms of intelligence, these last few months we have left before our assault on the continent are going to count.
