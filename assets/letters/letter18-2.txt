Dated March 1944

Dear William,

I have some unfortunate news. We have just gotten word from another one of our listening posts that the Germans have caught wind of our failed practice run of the Normandy landings. This is very un-serendipitous indeed, especially given how close the real invasion is. We can only hope that what they know at present is not enough to trounce us when the time comes.

Happily, as things stand, we have a great deal of information in place to ensure that our landings be a success. Though they certainly won't mark the end of our efforts here, it is time to begin the final push with regards to the assault. Perhaps, once they have been completed, and - one would hope - successfully at that, we can have something of a well-earned break.

I'll see you in the hut.
