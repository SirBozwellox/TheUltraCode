Dated January 1944

Dear Mr. Taylor,

Surplus to our regular communications, I have some rather unfortunate news for you and the staff. Our old colleague, Mr. Newman, was recently killed whilst on board a vessel bound to America. The loss of valuable ex-staff members does not bode well for us. He will be sorely missed.

However, there is no time to dwell on his death at present, because Military Intelligence have called on us to gather intelligence for another crucial operation. 'Operation Neptune', as they have dubbed it, will plan for the paradropping of troops behind enemy lines to target German radar stations ahead of any amphibious or land assault we might mount. Hence, it will be crucial for us to ascertain the locations of said stations, as well as any other essential information of the sort.

You know the score. Get to the briefing room, and then get down to decoding. Your efforts might yet make the difference we need.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
