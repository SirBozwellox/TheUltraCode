Dear William,

Excellent news! Our intelligence efforts towards Operation Overlord have now been completed. With all of the essential information in place, our boys should be able to make the landing a success. This is a major step for us indeed, and although only time will tell how things are going to pan out for us, I believe a celebration is in order. I will see you in the Operations Room for debriefing.

You've done a truly fantastic job.
