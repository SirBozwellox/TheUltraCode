Dated May 1944

Mr. Taylor,

>3
It is with great pleasure that I am now able to inform you that our intelligence efforts towards Operation Overlord have now been completed. Thanks to your accomplishments, as well as those of your colleagues here at Bletchley Park, our assault on the continent now has at least a fighting chance of success. Although only time will tell if we have done enough to change the course of the war, we have at least opened the way to tip the scales back in our favour.

Therefore, I believe a celebration is in order. See me and the brass in the Operations Room for debriefing.

Good work, Mr. Taylor.

Commander E. W. H. Travis
