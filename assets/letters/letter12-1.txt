Dear Bill,

Information has just begun coming in on the opening stages of our offensive on mainland Italy. So far, General Montgomery's forces have managed a successful landing at Salerno, Calabria and Taranto and have gone on to establish an effective foothold on the peninsula.

We have also received reports with regards to our efforts on 'Operation Bodyguard', and I believe a congratulations is in order, because we have successfully influenced the Germans into diverting troops away from Normandy. This should, in the best-case scenario, give our landing forces much better odds in establishing a sufficient beachhead on the continent.

With our bombing campaign on Germany in full swing, and yielding the desired results, your labor is now requested for another important operation. 'Gambit', as it has been dubbed, pertains to uncovering German submarine operations in the channel. We'll fill you in more at the briefing.
